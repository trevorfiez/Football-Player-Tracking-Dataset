# Football Player Tracking Dataset

This repository holds the annotations we have used for player detection, and player tracking.

It does not hold the raw images, but the instructions to download them are below.

If you are at Oregon State and have access to the vision server, the dataset is currently located under /scratch/datasets/NFL/football_players

The NFL does not necessarily support this so at some point they might shut this down. At the time of
building this repository, May 18, 2017, it was still working.
If that is the case the Dataset is pretty much shot
and nothing I nor anyone else can do will fix that.

Anyways on a sunnier note, now you can download NFL games from the coaches viewpoint!

We used a few specific games for these annotations:

To download them use the command:
